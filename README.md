1. How do I approach designing software?
What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?
What design process did you follow for your project work?
How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
>> I approach designing software by first understanding the pieces I need to do what I want to do. I like being creative so I want to ensure that I understand the pieces involved in the art. I think the best process I learned from this project was to take it step by step and one piece at a time. I enjoyed the structure of the class this time around and love the approach of building on the same design and adding the layers week to week. I like to do this in my songwriting where we start with one piece and then layer it from there. 

2. How do I approach developing programs?
What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
How did iteration factor into your development?
How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
>> I like to start with a template in mind. The vision needs to be set and I approach every project with an open mind and organization. I like laying out the plan and building from there. Again, one step at a time helps to ensure the vision continues to play out and it is okay to make adjustments along the way. 

3. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?
>> Computer science can help me reach my goals because it sets such a solid foundation to continue to grow in my field and accomplish the growth professionally that I am trying to achieve.
